Coursework for the module COMS21202 Symbols, Patterns and Signals @ University of Bristol

Module is an introduction to data driven computation and representation of relevant objects. Coursework 1 includes clustering a given data set using k-means, k-nearest neighbours then maximum likelihood classification, where changing certain parameters in the maximum likelihood classification algorithm results in the same decision boundaries as k-nearest neighbours. Coursework 2 was completely optional and involves classification of certain characters based on its Fourier transform
